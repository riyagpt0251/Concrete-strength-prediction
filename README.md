# Concrete-strength-prediction

🏢 Concrete Strength Prediction Project

🔍 Overview

This project aims to predict the compressive strength of concrete using multiple linear regression. The dataset used for this project contains information about the composition and curing time of concrete, along with its measured compressive strength. This predictive model can help optimize the design of concrete mixtures in construction projects.
